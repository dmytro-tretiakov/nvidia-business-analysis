# NVIDIA Business Analysis  
## Financial, Market & Sentiment Analysis
### Databricks | Python | Spark SQL
### Team Member: Dmytro Tretiakov  

## Project Overview
This group project analyzes NVIDIA’s stock prices, financial data, market performance, and social sentiment using Python and SQL in Databricks. A data pipeline was built to ingest and transform data from REST APIs and CSV datasets, enabling actionable business insights through time-series analysis. The study examines the following key dimensions:
1. **Stock price and financial data (My Focus)**
2. **Market Analysis**
3. **Social Media Sentiment Analysis**

Throughout this project, I was responsible for the **Stock price Trend and Year over Year Growth analysis** section. I developed an automated data pipeline and conducted a time-series analysis in Databricks to track NVIDIA’s stock price trends across weekly, monthly, and yearly intervals and analyze stock price year-over-year growth.
